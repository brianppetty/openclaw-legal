  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="effective">Effective Date: February 14, 2026</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the “OpenClaw” application (“App”) handles information. OpenClaw is a private, self-hosted QuickBooks Online integration application developed and operated exclusively by Fields of Dreams Farms, Inc. (“we,” “us,” or “our”).</p>

  <h2>Nature of the Application</h2>
  <p>OpenClaw is an internal business tool. It is not a publicly available application and is not distributed to any third parties. The App is used solely by the business owner of Fields of Dreams Farms, Inc. to interface with the company’s own QuickBooks Online account.</p>

  <h2>Data We Access</h2>
  <p>OpenClaw accesses financial and business data from the Fields of Dreams Farms, Inc. QuickBooks Online account through Intuit’s API. This data belongs exclusively to Fields of Dreams Farms, Inc. and is accessed solely for internal business operations.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>OpenClaw is self-hosted on infrastructure controlled by Fields of Dreams Farms, Inc. No data accessed through the App is stored on third-party cloud services. All data remains on company-controlled systems or within the QuickBooks Online platform.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise share any data accessed through OpenClaw with any third parties. Data is used exclusively for internal business purposes.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App connects to Intuit’s QuickBooks Online API to read and manage company financial data. Use of that API is governed by Intuit’s own terms of service and privacy policy.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We take reasonable measures to protect the data accessed by OpenClaw, including restricting access to the sole authorized user (the business owner) and hosting the application on controlled infrastructure.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.</p>
